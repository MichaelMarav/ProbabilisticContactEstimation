dataset collected from raisim, 
ATLAS robot locomotion using  LIPM locomotion
Variety of friction coefficient, each csv different friction coefficient
for the Right foot of atlas

Labels for stable contact are produced using coulomb friction  model
Each .csv is 20 steps long

----------------------------------------------

go1 -> 1000 Hz 
The "IMU" is set on the link of the foot
time, vel_x, vel_y, vel_z , w_x , w_y , w_z
